--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price) price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum), avg(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity >2;
